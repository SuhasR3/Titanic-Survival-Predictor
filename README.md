A data science project exploring survival predictions on the Titanic dataset using machine learning techniques.

## Overview
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning models. Built as part of a Kaggle challenge, it showcases practical data science workflows and insights into what factors influenced survival aboard the RMS Titanic.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Machine learning models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Linear SVC, Support Vector Machine, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Perceptron, Naive Bayes)
- Performance evaluation and insights

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
   git clone https://github.com/SuhasR3/TitanicDataDive.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) and place it in the `Dataset/` folder.

### Usage
Open `titanic_data_solutions.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to run the analysis step-by-step.

## Results
Achieved the following accuracy values.
